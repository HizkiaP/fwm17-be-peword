## About The Project
<p>
This website is designed for two main groups: those searching for workers and those seeking work opportunities. Users can upload their work experience and showcase their portfolios, making it easier for potential employers or clients to find them. On the other hand, individuals looking to hire can browse through these profiles to find workers who meet their specific needs and requirements. This platform aims to streamline the process of connecting job seekers with potential employers or projects, enhancing efficiency and facilitating meaningful professional connections.
